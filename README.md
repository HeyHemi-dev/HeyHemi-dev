Hi, I'm Hemi. I combine full-stack engineering and product experience to build digital products users love. Drawing from my entrepreneurial background, I take a holistic approach to development—focusing on user needs while creating scalable, thoughtful products.

**Currently Building:** Wedding Ready

> Wedding Ready is wedding platform inspired by Pinterest, which aims to solve the problem for couples making their dreams a reality. Every idea on Wedding Ready links directly to local suppliers who can bring it to life.
